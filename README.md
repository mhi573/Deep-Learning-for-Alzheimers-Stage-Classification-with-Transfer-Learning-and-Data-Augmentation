# Deep-Learning-for-Alzheimers-Stage-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning-and-Data-Augmentation

## Abstract
Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, can be diagnosed using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, but manual analysis of MRI scans is time-consuming and subject to variability among clinicians. Deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offers a promising solution for assisting clinicians or automating AD stage classification. This study explores CNN-based classification of AD stages (no dementia, very mild dementia, mild dementia, or moderate dementia) using MRI scan images. The primary goal was to compare the performance of a CNN that was developed and fine-tuned to pre-trained models (InceptionV3, VGG16, and EfficientNetB1). The secondary goal was to explore the impact of data augmentation on performance and generalization. Results showed that transfer learning is a viable option for the utilization of deep learning CNNs as a diagnostic tool for Alzheimer’s disease stages. Further, data augmentation may be a technique that improves the performance of pretrained models. Future work should focus on how to implement the use of pre-trained CNNs in medical settings to assist clinicians in their decision-making. <br /><br />
